# Detailed Session Log

**Date:** 2025-06-18
**Start Time:** 19:03 (approx)
**End Time:** 19:45
**Project:** Rigging Web Portal

## 1. Goals for the Session
- Initialize React project with Vite.
- Integrate Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS and autoprefixer (later revised to use `@tailwindcss/vite`).
- Build out basic application structure with routing and placeholder pages.
- Implement a Swiss-Minimal design system based on a detailed specification.

## 2. Accomplishments

*   **Project Setup & Tailwind CSS:**
    *   Successfully initialized a React project using Vite in `/Users/rpacker/Projects/rigging/web`.
    *   Overcame initial Tailwind CSS v4 setup challenges by adopting the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, removing direct `postcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies.
    *   Configured `tailwind.config.js` and `vite.config.js` for the new setup.
    *   Updated `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";`.
*   **Basic Application Structure:**
    *   Installed `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
    *   Created placeholder pages: `HomePage.jsx`, `PackageDetailPage.jsx`, `PublishPage.jsx` in `src/pages/`.
    *   Implemented basic layout (header, main, footer) and routing in `App.jsx`.
*   **Content Expansion:**
    *   Added `GettingStartedPage.jsx` and `DocumentationPage.jsx` with initial content.
    *   Updated `HomePage.jsx` with a project description and "Coming Soon" indicators.
    *   Updated navigation in `App.jsx` to include new pages.
*   **Swiss-Minimal Design System Implementation (Initial Pass):**
    *   Installed `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin.
    *   Updated `tailwind.config.js` with design tokens (colors, Inter font, modular type scale, spacing).
    *   Set up local "Inter" font files (Regular 400, Medium 500, Bold 700) in `public/fonts/inter/` and added `@font-face` rules to `src/index.css`.
    *   Applied new global styles in `src/index.css` and removed conflicting Vite defaults.
    *   Refactored all existing React components (`App.jsx`, `HomePage.jsx`, `PackageDetailPage.jsx`, `PublishPage.jsx`, `GettingStartedPage.jsx`, `DocumentationPage.jsx`) to apply the new Tailwind utility classes based on the design specification.
    *   Iterated on the design for `App.jsx` (header, footer) and `HomePage.jsx` (hero, doc cards) based on initial USER feedback to refine spacing, hierarchy, and component definition.

## 3. Technical Decisions & Discoveries

*   **Tailwind CSS v4 Integration:** The primary technical decision was to switch from a manual PostCSS setup to the official `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. This simplified configuration and resolved CLI execution issues.
*   **Local Fonts:** Opted for serving the "Inter" font locally for better control and to avoid third-party dependencies, as per the design spec.
*   **Component-Based Styling:** Adhered to using Tailwind utility classes directly in components.
*   **Iterative Design:** The session highlighted that translating a design spec to code is iterative and requires ongoing feedback.

## 4. Implementation Details

*   **`tailwind.config.js`:** Heavily customized `theme.extend` with specific values for `colors`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `spacing`, `maxWidth`, `height`, `outlineWidth`, `outlineColor`, and `translate`. Added `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin.
*   **`src/index.css`:** Added `@font-face` rules for three weights of Inter. Established global `body` styles and `*:focus-visible` styles using `@apply` with new theme tokens. Removed most default Vite styles.
*   **React Components:**
    *   `App.jsx`: Updated for full-width sticky header, refined logo and nav link styling, adjusted main content padding for sticky header, increased footer padding.
    *   `HomePage.jsx`: Hero section headline changed to sentence case, prominence adjusted. Tagline opacity modified. Spacing between hero elements increased. Code block placeholder styled. Doc card section padding increased, card borders added.
    *   Other pages (`PackageDetailPage`, `PublishPage`, `GettingStartedPage`, `DocumentationPage`) were updated to use new typography and layout classes, with `prose` classes applied to documentation pages.

## 5. Challenges & Solutions

*   **Initial Tailwind CSS Setup:** The initial attempt to set up Tailwind CSS using `tailwindcss init -p` and manual `postcss.config.js` was problematic with Tailwind v4.
    *   **Solution:** Researched current best practices for Vite and Tailwind v4, leading to the adoption of the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, which resolved the issues.
*   **Design Realization:** The first pass at implementing the Swiss-Minimal design spec resulted in a look that was "too minimal" and had "accidental" feeling spacing.
    *   **Solution (In Progress):** Began an iterative refinement process based on USER feedback, focusing on improving the header, hero section, and card definitions. This is an ongoing challenge.

## 6. Next Steps for Next Session

*   **Design Refinement:**
    *   Continue iterating on the visual design based on USER feedback. The goal is to achieve a highly polished, intentional Swiss-Minimal aesthetic.
    *   Focus areas: spacing (vertical rhythm, whitespace), typographic hierarchy, component definition (making elements feel distinct and well-crafted).
    *   Consider using visual references or mockups if provided by the USER to guide implementation.
*   **Markdown Rendering:**
    *   Implement a dedicated `MarkdownRenderer.jsx` component using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`.
    *   Style the output of this component using `@tailwindcss/typography` and customize its theme via `tailwind.config.js` to align perfectly with the design tokens.
*   **Component Library:**
    *   Begin formally creating reusable components from the design spec (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `CodeBlock`) if patterns solidify.
*   **Accessibility Review:**
    *   Once styling is more stable, conduct a more thorough accessibility check (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes if needed, contrast ratios beyond text).

## 7. Open Questions / Blockers

*   The primary open item is achieving the desired level of design polish. Further specific feedback and potentially visual examples will be key.
