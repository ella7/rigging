# Core Instructions for AI Assistants

## General Guidelines
- Always reference `/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation standards, development practices, and project management guidelines. If you are ever unsure about what to do, read AGENTS.md to see if that helps.
- If you are unsure about the requested task or how to accomplish it, always ask for clarification
- Before starting any significant new work, confirm the previous step was completed successfully and verify the user is ready to proceed

## Project Documentation
- Reference `/docs/prd.md` for high-level product requirements
- Reference `/docs/implementation.md` for technical implementation details
- Update `/docs/progress.md` when making progress on project tasks
- Document technical breakthroughs in `/docs/critical-learnings.md`
- Store session plans in `/docs/session_plans/`
- Store detailed session logs in `/docs/session_details/`

## Development Environment
- When running Python code for this project, ALWAYS use the virtual environment located in the `.venv` directory by prefixing commands with `source .venv/bin/activate &&`

## Code Management
- Place all test and experimental code in the `sandbox` directory
- Add proper status comments to sandbox files (see AGENTS.md for details)
- Always ask before changing file status from "non-functional" to "working-as-designed"
- At the end of each session, list non-functional sandbox files and ask about deletion

## Session Management
- Refer to AGENTS.md and the /start-coding-session and /end-coding-session workflows for detailed session management procedures.

## Package Management
- Use uv for package management whenever possible
- Use `uv install package_name` instead of `pip install package_name`
- Use direct uv commands when possible for better performance
- The project uses uv.lock for deterministic dependency resolution
